    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a way to provide one and only one object of a particular type. The Singleton class can have only one instance, and provides global access to that one instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to its instantiation restrictions of a class to one object, this pattern is useful when you need one object to coordinate actions for the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is that only one instance of a particular class, doing a job, is created for the needs of the program. To ensure that this works, we need mechanisms that prevent the instantiation of the class more than once and also prevent cloning."

    "* Route mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases,information flows in one direction, and the singleton instance itself is immutable (it does not change).\n",
    "No part of the program attempts to make a change in the singleton, and as such there is no danger of one part of a project interfering with another part of the project because of the shared state.\n",
